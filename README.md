# AlphaLogic
AlphaLogic is a clothing based e-commerce website developed using java. The core objective of the project was to take a first step to obtain knowledge on the technologies currently being used in development of ecommerce websites and to increase experience and expertise in the area. Accordingly, the project was constructed to allow familiarisation with the internet market, and with the ways and methods such online shopping portals are developed. The project was executed as a dummy and provided sufficient knowledge and expertise to help in development of a live project.
